Troubleshooting these errors often requires a systematic approach:

1. **Clean the project:** Use `expo prebuild --clean` to remove existing build artifacts.
2. **Check the Expo CLI version:** Ensure you have the latest version using `expo update`.
3. **Examine Gradle files:** Check `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` for any misconfigurations or version conflicts.
4. **Inspect error logs:** Carefully analyze the full output of the Expo CLI build command to identify any specific error messages or warnings.  Look for clues related to missing dependencies, version conflicts, or other build system issues.
5. **Update dependencies:** Use `expo install` to update all packages or specific packages causing issues. 
6. **Invalidate caches:** In Android Studio, try invalidating caches and restarting.
7. **Check Android SDK and NDK:** Ensure you have the necessary components installed and that the paths are correctly configured in your environment.
8. **Check the signing configurations:** Verify that you have correctly configured the signing configurations in the Android build files.   If publishing, ensure a valid keystore is correctly set up. 
9. **Search for similar issues online:** If you can't identify the problem, search online using the specific error messages for solutions from others. 
10. **Upgrade Gradle:** Sometimes upgrading Gradle (specified in the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file) to the latest version resolves compatibility problems. 

This systematic approach should assist in diagnosing and resolving a wide range of these uncommon Expo CLI Android build errors.  Remember to consult the Expo documentation and related community forums for further assistance.
