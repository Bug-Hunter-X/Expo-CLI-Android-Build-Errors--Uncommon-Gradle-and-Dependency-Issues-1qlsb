This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves issues with the Android build system, Gradle, or related dependencies.  It's not a specific, easily identifiable error message, but rather a collection of problems that can manifest during the build process. For example, you might encounter dependency resolution errors, issues with signing configurations, or problems with the Android SDK or NDK.  The root cause often varies, making it difficult to provide a one-size-fits-all solution.  Symptoms include build failures with cryptic error messages, slow build times, or builds that halt unexpectedly.
